🛡️ GenAI Red Teaming for SMEs: Preventing Data Leakage in RAG Bots

This project outlines a specialized cybersecurity consulting service aimed at addressing the unique security vulnerabilities of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) GenAI bots deployed by Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).

Our approach uses efficient, automated Red Teaming Audits to provide targeted assurance against threats like Prompt Injection and Sensitive Data Disclosure, solving a critical gap where generic security firms and internal IT lack specialized LLM expertise.

💡 The Business Idea at a Glance

Component

Description

Need

SMEs lack specialized expertise to secure new RAG bots against LLM-specific attacks, leading to high risk of data leakage and compliance failure.

Approach

Standardized, automated Red Team Audit using Promptfoo and proprietary test suites. Cost-efficient fixed scope.

Benefit

Rapid, prioritized remediation, high value-for-money, and compliance mapping (OWASP, MITRE, NIST).

USP

Specialized focus on SME RAG systems combined with cost-efficient, tool-driven automation.
