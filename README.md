# 🛡️ GenAI Red Teaming for SMEs: Preventing Data Leakage in RAG Bots

This project outlines a specialized **cybersecurity consulting service** aimed at addressing the unique security vulnerabilities of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** GenAI bots deployed by **Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)**.

Our approach uses **efficient, automated Red Teaming Audits** to provide targeted assurance against threats like **Prompt Injection** and **Sensitive Data Disclosure**, solving a critical gap where generic security firms and internal IT lack specialized LLM expertise.
