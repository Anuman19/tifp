# 🛡️ GenAI Red Teaming for SMEs: Preventing Data Leakage in RAG Bots

This project outlines a specialized **cybersecurity consulting service** aimed at addressing the unique security vulnerabilities of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** GenAI bots deployed by **Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs)**.

Our approach uses **efficient, automated Red Teaming Audits** to provide targeted assurance against threats like **Prompt Injection** and **Sensitive Data Disclosure**, solving a critical gap where generic security firms and internal IT lack specialized LLM expertise.

## 💡 The Business Idea at a Glance

| **Component** | **Description** |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Need** | SMEs lack specialized expertise to secure new RAG bots against LLM-specific attacks, leading to high risk of data leakage and compliance failure. |
| **Approach** | Standardized, automated Red Team Audit using Promptfoo and proprietary test suites. Cost-efficient fixed scope. |
| **Benefit** | Rapid, prioritized remediation, high value-for-money, and compliance mapping (OWASP, MITRE, NIST). |
| **USP** | Specialized focus on SME RAG systems combined with cost-efficient, tool-driven automation. |
